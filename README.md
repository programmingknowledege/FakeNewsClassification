## Fake-News Deection with Apache Spark and Databricks - Team 2
https://projects.cs.nott.ac.uk/psxtc5/bigdata-fake-news-detection


# Description
This project explores an effective way to identify misinformation by using sophisticated big data solution, including Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and Databricks. It focuses on processing vast, ongoing data streams, integrating real-time RSS feeds with static news databases. The system enhances its efficiency through high-level preprocessing methods such as normalization and tokenization, along with effective data management practices that reduce computational demands. The approach combines various modeling techniques such as global, local, and ensembleâ€”to achieve a well rounded performance, with an accuracy, precision, and recall rate of about 72.5% and an F1 score of 72.3%.

# Getting started
The model code is in './model'
The kafka code is in './kafka'
The data ingestion code is in './data-pipeline'


# Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

Models
1. global-model: This file consists of implementation of global approach 
2. local-model: This file consists of implementation of local approach 
3. ensemble-model: This file consists of implementation of bagging technique 
4. global-model-test: This file consists of test dataset code for testing global approach solution
